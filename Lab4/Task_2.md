### Lab 4 Operating System Tasks

### **Arham Imran 2022-CS-209**

#### Task 2.1 : Simple script that uses **arithmetic** operators (+, -, *, etc.) using double parenthesis with printing your own roll # with the results of the operations.

- Arithmetic operators in bash script are used to **perform** **arithmetic** operations.
- Bash script supports 11 arithmetic operators as follows.
  - '**+**' : **Addition** : It adds two numbers.
  - '**-**' : **Subtraction** : It subtract second operand from first one.
  - '*****' : **Multiplication** : Multiply two operands.
  - '**/**' : **Division** : Returns the quotient after dividing first operand from second operand.
  - '**%**' : **Modulo** : Return remainder after dividing first operand from second operand.
  - '**+=**' : **Increment by constant** : Increments value of the first operand with given constant value.
  - '**-=**' : **Decrement by constant** : Decrements value of the first operand with given constant value.
  - '***=**' : **Multiply by constant** : Multiply the given operand with the constant value.
  - '**/=**' : **Divide by constant** : Divide the operand with given constant value and return the quotient.
  - '**%=**' : **Remainder by dividing with constant** : Divide the operand with given constant value and return the remainder.
  - '******' : **Exponentiation** : The result is second operand raised to the power of the first.
- The following code is how you use Arithmetic operators in bash script.

#### Task 2.2 : Write a simple shell script that uses **relational** operators

- Relational Operators are those operators which define a **relation** between **two** operands.
- They give either true or false depending upon the relation.
- There are 6 different kinds of relational operators
  - **'==' Equal to** : Returns true if two operands are equal else false.
  - '!=' Not Equal to : Returns true if two operands are not equal else false.
  - **'<' Less Than** : Returns true if the first operand is less than the second one else false.
  - '<=' Less Than Equal to : Returns true if the first operand is less than the second one or equal to the second one otherwise returns false.
  - **'>' Greater Than** : Returns true if the first operand is greater than the second one otherwise false.
  - **'>=' Greater Than Equal to** : Returns true if the first operand is greater than the second one or equal to the second one otherwise returns false.
- The following code shows how to use relational operators.
  - ![](task_2_images\Lab4_Task2_4.png)
    - Takes two integer inputs from the user and checks the if conditions.
    - If the condition inside the if block is true then the statement after 'then' command will be executed else statement after else will be executed. 
    - 'fi' is the keyword for end if to tell the interpreter that if statement is ended.
